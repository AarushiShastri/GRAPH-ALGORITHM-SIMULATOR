# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive **Graph Algorithm Simulator** built using Python's **Tkinter GUI framework**, **NetworkX**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The tool visually demonstrates popular **Graph Traversal** and **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms through step-by-step animations.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Algorithm Categories:**
  - Graph Traversal: BFS (Breadth-First Search) & DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - MST Algorithms: Prim's Algorithm & Kruskal's Algorithm

- **Interactive Graph Building:**
  - Click-based node and edge creation using Matplotlib canvas.
  - Random edge weights generation with built-in button.
  - Canvas clearing & reset functionality.

- **Real-Time Visualization:**
  - Step-by-step animations for BFS, DFS, Prim’s, and Kruskal’s algorithms.
  - Separate windows for side-by-side comparisons of algorithms.
  - Displays data structures (Queue, Stack, Edge List) used internally during simulations.
  - Visual time complexity display for each algorithm.

- **Beautiful Pastel-Themed Interface:**
  - Custom pastel color palette.
  - User-friendly buttons for controlling modes and simulations.
